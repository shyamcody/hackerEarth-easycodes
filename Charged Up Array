#the problem may sound sophisticated, but supposedly you are not allowed to remove the repeatations.
#If you have found this one easy, try with removing repeatation.
#Here, the catch is that, 2^60>10^18 hence, you can put that cap there. And also you can not get 2 power anything as it will
#give you overflow errors.
