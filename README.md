# hackerEarth-easycodes
Hi! I am a medium level beginner in python and have been solving some questions each week from hackerearth and been dumping here.
If you are stuck in any code in hackerearth, please refer here once. Currently, I myself am solving only easy questions. Once 
sufficient easy questions are done, I will add a medium repository too. If you want to add solution in different language to these 
questions, please fork, add in a different file and then pull request.
